# CLI-Chat
Rudimentary command-line chat server and client, written in Rust.

Install `rustc` and `cargo`, Rust's compiler and project management tool, and in the command line, enter `cargo run` from the `chat_server` root, followed by doing the same in another command line on the `chat_client` root. IP address to connect is 127.0.0.1:7878 by default - change as desired.
